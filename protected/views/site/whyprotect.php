							Your right to safety and privacy shouldn't be limited to "the real world." Online security breaches, dishonest providers selling your secrets, have real and detrimental consequences.</p><p> SCRYPTmail can prevent these by HTTPS connection and front-end encryption of absolutely all transmitted data (both text and attachments) and advanced identity and password verification

						<p>
							Your emails include information about your family, friends, health and business.</p><p> Email security never only affect you. They can expose the private and sensitive information you share with people in your life. </p><p>Security matters both in private and business - it's never just limited to doctors and lawyers.

						<p>
							How would you even know if your email is being watched? Your data has been stolen? </p><p>Unless you are working in IT, it's probably difficult to even know how to find the footprints or evidence of any breaches. Even if you did find out, how would you know when or where it came from? </p><p>Prevent this from happening and start using SCRYPTmail now.
